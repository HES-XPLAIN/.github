# HES-XPLAIN

An open platform for accelerating the development of eXplainable AI systems

Description of our repositories:

- **[mlxplain](../../../../mlxplain)**: Comprehensive framework encompassing provided algorithms.
- **[rules-extraction](../../../../rules-extraction)**: High-level explanation algorithms, comprising of three approaches: rule extraction, local identification of relevant patterns, and generation of global meaningful patterns, in addition to the development of a novel algorithm combining these approaches to create comprehensive explanations.
- **[dimlpfidex](../../../../dimlpfidex)**: Low level explanation algorithms, extracting propositional rules from deep models where theprecise location of axis-parallel hyperplanes is known. Two new algorithms are presented, one for local explanation and the other for global explanations.
- **[fuge](../../../../fuge)**: Algorithm to construct fuzzy systems that predict human decision-making outcomes and provide understandable explanations.
- **[notebooks](../../../../notebooks)**: Use cases in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and related Docker files for easy deployment.
- **[docker-notebook-base](../../../../docker-notebook-base)**: Docker base image for the notebook, comprising of Jupyter and all dependency packages necessary to run the provided notebooks.
- **[huggingface.co/HES-XPLAIN](https://huggingface.co/HES-XPLAIN)**: Storage of our pre-trained models and datasets.
- **[hes-xplain.github.io](../../../../hes-xplain.github.io)**: Website for HES-XPLAIN, where general information, use case notebooks, documentations and download are provided.
