# HES-XPLAIN

An open platform for accelerating the development of eXplainable AI systems

Description of our repositories.

- **[mlxplain](../../../mlxplain)**: Development of a comprehensive framework encompassing provided algorithms.
- **[rules-extraction](../../../rules-extraction)**: Development of the high-level explanation algorithms, comprising of three approaches: rule extraction, local identification of relevant patterns, and generation of global meaningful patterns, in addition to the development of a novel algorithm combining these approaches to create comprehensive explanations.
- **[dimlpfidex](../../../dimlpfidex)**: Development of the low level explanation algorithms, extracting propositional rules from deep models where theprecise location of axis-parallel hyperplanes is known. Two new algorithms are presented, one for local explanation and the other for global explanations. 
- **[fuge](../../../fuge)**: . Algorithm to construct fuzzy systems that predict human decision-making outcomes and provide understandable explanations.
- **[notebooks](../../../notebooks)**: Development of our use cases Jupyter notebooks, and related Docker files for easy deployment.
- **[docker-notebook-base](../../../docker-notebook-base)**: Development of the docker base image for the notebook, comprising of Jupyter and all dependency packages necessary to run the provided notebooks.
- **[huggingface.co/HES-XPLAIN](https://huggingface.co/HES-XPLAIN)**: Storage of our pre-trained models.
- **[hes-xplain.github.io](../../../hes-xplain.github.io)**: The website for HES-XPLAIN, where general information, use case notebooks, documentations and download are provided.
